# 🚀 CodSoft C++ Internship Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing the five hands-on projects I built during my **C++ Programming Internship at [CodSoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codsoft/)**. Each project reflects a unique implementation of real-world functionality using core C++ concepts, culminating in a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving.

## 📂 Project List

### 1️⃣ Number Guessing Game 🎯
A simple interactive game where the user guesses a number randomly generated by the program within a limited number of tries.

- **Key Concepts:** Random number generation, loops, conditionals
- **File:** `Project 01`

---

### 2️⃣ Simple Calculator ➗✖️➕➖
A console-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

- **Key Concepts:** User input, switch-case, functions
- **File:** `Project 02`

---

### 3️⃣ Tic-Tac-Toe Game ❌⭕
A classic two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game played via the command line with a clear win/draw condition.

- **Key Concepts:** Arrays, control structures, game logic
- **File:** `Project 03`

---

### 4️⃣ To-Do List Manager ✅📋
A command-line application to manage tasks—add, delete, and display your daily goals in a simple to-do list.

- **Key Concepts:** File handling, vectors, basic CRUD operations
- **File:** `Project 04`

---

### 5️⃣ Image Processing Tool 🖼️🛠️
A robust C++ application (with OpenCV) that allows users to perform image operations like grayscale conversion, blur, sharpening, color adjustment, cropping, and resizing.

- **Key Features:**
  - Load and display images
  - Apply grayscale, blur, sharpen filters
  - Adjust brightness and contrast
  - Crop and resize images
  - Save processed image
- **File:** `Project 05`
- **Library:** OpenCV

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Libraries:** 
  - Standard Template Library (STL)
  - OpenCV (for image processing)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **Compiler:** g++ (via GCC)
- **Platform:** macOS (works on Linux & Windows too)
- **Package Manager:** Homebrew (for installing OpenCV on macOS)

---

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run

### Compile any basic project (e.g., Project 1–4):

 ``bash
g++ Project 01 -o game./game

### Compile for Project 5 :

``bash
g++ Project 05 -o image_tool `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
./image_tool

## ✅ Project Outcomes

Through this internship, I successfully developed **five complete C++ projects** from scratch, each targeting a different application domain:

1. 🎮 **Number Guessing Game** – Applied logic building and input handling.
2. 🧮 **Simple Calculator** – Reinforced control structures and function creation.
3. ❌⭕ **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** – Practiced game logic and turn-based loops.
4. ✅ **To-Do List** – Strengthened file handling and CRUD operations.
5. 🖼️ **Image Processing Tool** – Integrated external libraries (OpenCV) for real-world image editing.

These projects not only strengthened my core programming skills but also taught me practical software development practices, such as:
- Code modularization
- Debugging techniques
- Version control with Git
- Creating user-friendly interfaces (CLI & GUI)
